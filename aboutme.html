<br><br>
<i> 
I was born in Teluk Intan, Perak but raised in Sungai Petani, Kedah , a town known for its vibrant culture and close-knit community. Growing up in such an environment fostered a sense of belonging and instilled in me the importance of connection and empathy. My family, consisting of my loving parents and supportive siblings, played a pivotal role in shaping my character. Their unwavering support and encouragement have fueled my aspirations and taught me the value of perseverance.
<br><br>
Education has always been a cornerstone of my life. From a young age, I exhibited a thirst for knowledge and a curiosity to explore various disciplines. As a result, I dedicated myself to my studies, consistently striving for excellence. I believe that education is not confined to textbooks alone but extends to the realm of personal growth and development. By engaging in extracurricular activities, participating in debates, and joining clubs, I nurtured my interpersonal skills, critical thinking, and leadership abilities.
<br><br>
While academics have played a significant role in my life, my passions and interests have shaped my identity beyond the classroom. One of my deepest passions is reading.I was taught as a child to read more books, such as storybooks and comic books. My family members bought and gave me a lot of books to help me learn more. As a result of this, I became interested in reading instructional books, such as history books and beneficial novels. Additionally, I find solace in watching anime and hearing musics in spotify. These pursuits not only bring me joy but also provide a sense of balance and enable me to explore different facets of my personality.
<br><br>
As I stand on the precipice of the future, I have developed a clear vision of my goals and aspirations which is I want to get diploma and degree and in the future I want to open my own Cafe. By pursuing these ambitions, I hope to make a meaningful impact on the world, whether through my chosen career path, contributing to my community, or promoting positive change on a global scale. I am determined to embrace new opportunities, embrace growth, and leave a lasting legacy that inspires others to do the same.
